# FilmList

A WIP film list app that allows a user to search for and edit a selection of films. The app uses Firebase for storage and as an external API, along with Materialize for styling.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To get this up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd FilmList
2) npm install
3) npm start

The app runs on localhost:3000, with the form viewable on localhost:3000/form.
